# AudicaMaker
A tool used to create audica files.

New version http://www.mediafire.com/file/bmfe1od176jjv4w/AudicaMaker.rar/file

-Red dots should be fixed

-File drop added, you can now drop files in the text input widgets that requires a file or drop project and desc files anywhere in the window to import/load them.

-Fixed that midi file bug, midi files should now build as expected in the audica file

-Application is now named as expected and has an icon in the winow bar

If you want to run from source, you will need Python 2.7 and run the "InstallDependencies.bat" file. Batch file expects that python is installed in windows path. You can then either run "source\main.py" manually or double click on "RunPythonSource.bat".
If you want to build from source, you will need all the above and run the "Build.bat" File.
